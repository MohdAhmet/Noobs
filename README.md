The final project relates to the functioning of three sensors (ultrasound, water level, and temperature) with their respective actuators. This project is developed to simulate a scale problem inside a ship (ballast tanks and fuel tanks) for emergency cases.

In each student folder (Devaprasad, Mohammed, and Valentina) you will find the solution for each lab for the lecture I4ET. 
Meanwhile, the AA_FINALPROJECT includes the required codes and additional files (pictures, videos, dashboard scheme, etc.) for the final project.

All the exercises were done for the software Arduino IDE and Arduino Cloud.
